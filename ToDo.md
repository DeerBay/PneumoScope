# **To-Do List: Pneumonia Detection and Classification Project**

## **1. Project Setup**
- [ ] Create a GitHub repository with a clear name and description.
- [ ] Set up a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).
- [ ] Create a `README.md` file with an initial project description.
- [ ] Add a `.gitignore` file (include common Python files and dataset folders).
- [ ] List project dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

## **2. Data Preparation**
- [ ] Download the dataset from Kaggle.
- [ ] Organize the dataset into appropriate directories (`train`, `test`, `val`).
- [ ] Explore the dataset (e.g., check for class imbalance, image size).
- [ ] Perform data preprocessing:
  - [ ] Resize images to a uniform size.
  - [ ] Normalize image pixel values.
  - [ ] Apply data augmentation (e.g., flipping, rotation, zoom).

## **3. Model Development**
- [ ] Choose baseline CNN architecture (e.g., simple CNN).
- [ ] Train a binary classification model (pneumonia vs. no pneumonia).
- [ ] Train a ternary classification model (bacterial vs. viral vs. no pneumonia).
- [ ] Experiment with pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, Inception).
- [ ] Implement transfer learning if using pre-trained models.

## **4. Model Evaluation**
- [ ] Evaluate models on the test set.
- [ ] Compute key metrics:
  - [ ] Accuracy
  - [ ] Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - [ ] ROC-AUC
- [ ] Create and display confusion matrices.
- [ ] Save model performance results for comparison.

## **5. Optimization**
- [ ] Fine-tune hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs).
- [ ] Implement early stopping and learning rate scheduling.
- [ ] Test different optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD).
- [ ] Experiment with different data augmentation strategies.

## **6. Visualization**
- [ ] Plot training and validation loss/accuracy curves.
- [ ] Visualize some correctly and incorrectly classified images.
- [ ] Use Grad-CAM or similar techniques to interpret model predictions.

## **7. Deployment (Optional)**
- [ ] Convert the trained model to a format suitable for deployment (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, ONNX).
- [ ] Create a simple web app using Flask or Streamlit for real-time prediction.
- [ ] Test the web app with sample X-ray images.

## **8. Documentation**
- [ ] Update the `README.md` file with detailed instructions on:
  - [ ] Project overview
  - [ ] How to set up the environment
  - [ ] How to run the model
  - [ ] Results and performance metrics
- [ ] Add comments to the code for clarity.
- [ ] Write a brief project report (if required by your course).

## **9. Final Steps**
- [ ] Review and clean the code.
- [ ] Commit all changes and push to GitHub.
- [ ] Share the project link with your course instructors or peers.
